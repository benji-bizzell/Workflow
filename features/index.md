## How to Use This Index

1. **Find a domain** that matches your feature area
2. **Navigate** to `features/{folder-name}/`
3. **Create or update** the feature within that domain

## Adding New Domains

When a feature doesn't fit existing domains:
1. Add a new row to the table above
2. Create the folder: `features/{new-domain}/`
3. Consider if existing features should be reorganized

---

## Quick Start

Use the `feature-workflow` skill to create new features:
```
/feature-workflow
```

This will guide you through:
- Selecting or creating a domain
- Setting up the feature folder structure
- Creating the initial FEATURE.md
